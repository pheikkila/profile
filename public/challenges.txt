fun problems

- what is the height of an asset 157x157px when rotated 20 degrees
	- ran into this problem creating a max height for my fridge. 
	  It's an interesting problem I could have hacked through, but I was curious how I'd go about solving this mathemetically

- blending roach killer image
	- I wasn't totally satisfied with the way my 2 unrelated images for the roach killer scene started out
	- used 2 different linear gradients to soften the merge between the two

- physics on fridge were fun to learn about
	- lot of nitpicking with changing it to absolute positioning, making it actually fall over and in an aesthetic way
